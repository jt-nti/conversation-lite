# conversation-lite

Slightly modified version of the [conversation-simple](https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/conversation-simple) Watson Conversation UI that can be hosted directly from a GitHub repository.

Before chatting, just provide your workspace ID, username and password, which can be found on the *Credentials* page of the Conversation tooling.

Currently requires [conversation-proxy](https://github.com/jthub/conversation-proxy) because the Watson Conversation API does not support [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing](https://enable-cors.org/).
